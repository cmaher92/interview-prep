*Trees*
Root -  is the top of the tree
height - of the tree is called the depth
node - each item of a tree
sub-tree - tree within the tree
internal-node - anything that's not a leaf

Root ->      0
            / \
           0   0
          / \ / \
         0  0 0  0

level | node count
------------------
0     | 1
1     | 2
2     | 4
k     | 2^k

Proof by induction:
In a binary tree there are 2^height -1 nodes

**Binary Trees**
**Search Trees**
**Tree traversals**
- Breadth-first
- Depth-first
  - in order
  - pre order
  - post order

**Applications**
tree map
file system
decision tree
game state
